This essay is an attempt to put down my thoughts on how to design a real-world yet beautiful RESTful API. It draws from the experience I have gained being involved in the design of the RESTful API for Red Hat’s Enterprise Virtualization product, twice. During the design phase of the API we had to solve many of the real-world problems described above, but we weren’t willing to add non-RESTful or “RPC-like” interfaces to our API too easily.
