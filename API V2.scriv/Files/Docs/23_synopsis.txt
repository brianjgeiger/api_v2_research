Traditionally, you’d expect most inquiries about APIs to be very technical: How can I upload bulk attachments with multipart POST bodies? Increasingly, questions are becoming more like amateur Stack Overflow questions: How do I hook the Microsoft Access into the REST? The users behind such questions aren’t tech-illiterate, they simply have no idea how to code and aren’t familiar with the lingo. They don’t really know where to start, but they want to know about your API.
